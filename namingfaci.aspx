           &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Naming your baby is one of the greatest joys of your life and a naming ceremony is intended for that occasion. Ceremonies may seem difficult to set up and organize but it doesn’t have to be that way. In Hinduism, Namkaran is an auspicious day for naming your baby. Traditionally, naming ceremonies are held right after birth but that’s not always the case. Some parents choose to host iT before their child’s first birthday while others pick specific months for the occasion. Either way, if you’re hunting for ideas on how to make this special day even bigger, we’ve got you covered.<br>

<h3>1. Prepare Your Invite List</h3><br>
There may have been times when you wished a certain someone didn’t show up. That’s why we have an invite list. If you don’t want to invite someone, make it clear that anyone without invites cannot enter the premises that day.<br>
<h3>2. Give Your Baby Some Space</h3><br>
Make sure there’s a private area arranged for you and your baby. Because you’ll need it for feeding times, changing dresses, and giving him/her some downtime when they feel overwhelmed seeing so many faces in one day.<br>
<h3>3. Set a Budget</h3><br>
This might not sound like a fancy a tip but it’s important. Don’t splurge unless you have the money to. Set up a budget and stick to it no matter what. You want to have a ceremony that’s fun, fits your bills, and doesn’t stress anyone one regarding money matters.<br>
<h3>4. Food Awesome</h3><br>
You don’t have to stick to a traditional Indian menu in your naming ceremony. With a halal menu, you have so many options. From tapioca pudding to fish and chips, biryanis, pizzas, and Arabian cuisine, you could make your menu the fusion variety. Again, an event organizer will give you better ideas on how to set up or prep the menu based on your budget.<br>
<h3>5. Use Different Colored Balloons</h3><br>
We’re a huge fan of balloons since they literally make parties (or any ceremony for that matter) colourful. Use strings and ribbons and make sure you have a wide variety for some fun. Put simply, they’ll make your namkaran day extra gorgeous and more joyful.<br>
<h3>7. Give Your Guests Flowers</h3><br>
The people you’ve invited have chalked out precious time to come and celebrate with you. Why not make them feel special by handing some flowers over whenever they walk in? They’ll definitely remember this day for life that way.<br>
