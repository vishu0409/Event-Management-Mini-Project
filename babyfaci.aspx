<h3>The Basics of How to Plan a Baby Shower</h3><br>
Typically, one of the mum-to-be’s close friends or family members organises and hosts the shower. She might have asked you, or you might have offered – either way it’s an honour! The mum-to-be usually doesn’t get too involved in the planning, after all, she’s the special guest. Even so, it’s good to discuss certain details, such as the guest list, with her.<br>
<h3>1.Choose a Time and Date</h3><br>
The months before and after the baby is born are hectic, so discuss potential dates with the mum-to-be. Usually, showers are held around four to six weeks before the due date, but consider these factors when deciding on a date:<br>
                   <h3> 2. Decide on a Location</h3><br>
Consider what the mum-to-be would love and you can’t go wrong. Of course, your budget, number of guests, and even the weather play a role in what kind of location could work best. Consider these ideas:<br>
      <b> A.Home (of the host or the mum-to-be): </b><br>
                     It’s private and comfortable. You have free reign in the kitchen, and everyone knows where the bathroom is. The mum-to-be’s home can be a convenient option but be mindful not to cause extra stress with intensive preparations and clean up. If the shower is held after the baby is born, the mum’s home could be a good choice because she and her newborn can stay comfortably at home.<br>
<b>B.Restaurant or café:</b><br> 
                     All you have to do is book a table, and you’re set. Try to accommodate everyone's tastes, but the mum-to-be's favourite spot would be a great choice.
Party venue: Venue staff can likely help arrange almost everything you’ll need but you could also personalise the space with your own decorations.<br>
<b>C.Outdoors:</b><br> If you have a scenic outdoor location nearby, it could be a great option! Consider a picnic at a tranquil park or placing a spread of sweets on a table next to a beautiful lake.<br><br>

<h3>3.Pick a Theme</h3><br>
Decide whether you’ll have a theme. You don’t have to have one, but if you think the mum-to-be would love it, choose something that reflects her personality and celebrates the new baby.<br>
<h3>4.the Guest List and Send Invitations</h3><br>
The number of guests depends on your budget, the space available at the venue, and who the mum-to-be would like to have there. You don’t want to miss someone who is important to her. At the same time, be honest about budget and venue limitations. Traditional showers were strictly ladies only, but, times have changed, and sometimes the male partner or male friends go along too. Ask the mum-to-be what she would like.<br>
<h3>5.Organise Decorations</h3><br>
There are lots of inspiring decoration ideas for you to consider when planning the baby shower. Typically, the food table is the centre of attention in terms of decorations. Decorate the food itself, choose matching table cloth, cutlery, serving platters, and hang signage, streamers, balloons, or pennant banners near the buffet. Nappy cakes make a great centrepiece, too. These DIY ‘cakes’ are made out of nappies to form a shape, such as a stroller. Take a look at these top decoration ideas for even more specific suggestions.<br>
<h3>6.Help Mum-to-Be With the Baby Registry</h3><br>
A baby registry helps guests know what they can give that the mum-to-be will really appreciate. If she’s chosen to have one, the mum-to-be usually puts it together, but you’ll need to add the details to the invitations. Help the mum-to-be by sending her this gift registry checklist so she knows what types of things she could include. The registry typically includes things the baby needs such as clothes, books, or basic supplies like nappies.<br>
