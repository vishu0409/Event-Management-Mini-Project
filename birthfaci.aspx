       &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; Birthday parties are a big deal, and these days, a game of pass the parcel and few balloons just won’t cut it. Log onto Facebook or Instagram and we’re sure some of your mummy mates will be posting pics of their little darlings jumping on a bouncy castle or looking adorable in princess costumes and face paint.<br>
    <h3>1. BUDGET</h3>
Enjoying a fun-filled day is a priority so make sure you plan exactly how much you want to spend and know how much all those extras will cost. By keeping a firm grip on budget, you can hopefully avoid costs spiralling out of control and money stresses ruining the big event.
     Make sure you factor in the cost of venue, decorations, food, the birthday cake, entertainment and party bags so you don’t have any nasty surprises when it is time to pay the bill.<br>
     <h3>2.GUEST LIST</h3>
Are you inviting all your child’s classmates or will they be happier among six to ten of their closest friends? By creating a guest list early on, you can get an idea of where to host the do, how much it will cost and whether or not you will be catering for adults as well. You can also plan activities and games accordingly.

We live in the era of the e-vite, so save some pennies by designing a cute paperless invitation or alternately you can create and print your own unique design on sites such asCanva orEvite.

Remember to keep track of the RSVPs and any special requests such as dietary needs! <br />

<h3>3.VENUE</h3>
Hosting the party at home is cheap and cheerful, but you will have a lot of tidying up to do afterwards. If you have a gang of helpers (younger siblings, grandparents….anyone!) get them to muck in and keep your fingers crossed for a sun-drenched day so the guests can spend some of the time in the garden instead of the front room.
    If you choose to hire a venue such as a local restaurant or kids’ soft play area, this will definitely ease your workload and take away the hassle of catering for hungry kids. Keep in mind however, hiring a venue will definitely add to the cost.

Summertime parties are much easier to plan as you could plan a birthday picnic in a local park or create a mini Olympics (think egg and spoon races rather than hurdles and javelin throwing) at a nearby recreation ground.

   <h3>4. CHOOSE A THEME</h3>
By choosing a theme, you immediately rev up the fun factor and get your birthday baby excited for their special day by choosing something they really love. Lots of you know the pain of watching Moana or Frozen for the 42nd time, so why not select a favourite film as a theme? Easy peasy! There will be endless related decorations and fancy-dress outfits to choose from and a good bakery can create a kids’ birthday cake to fit in with the chosen film...Spider Man, or the Little Mermaid...we could go on...<br>

     <h3> 5. CAKE, CAKE, CAKE </h3>
Now you have your numbers and your theme, it’s time for the ultimate decision…..it’s cake time. Yes, of course you can go for a perfectly fine (yawn), shop bought chocolate caterpillar (double yawn) or a tray bake with cut out stars, but it’s just so dull. You could also DIY your own cake (use our chocolate drip cake recipe here!) but should you not want the added stress or last-minute panic of a flop cake we really do recommend outsourcing to a professional!<br>

     <h3> 6. DRINKS</h3>
For a successful birthday party, we’d recommend avoiding fizzy drinks. Many parents don’t relish the thought of their children chugging back sugary pop, so opt for something less controversial.

Juice boxes, squash or a bottle of water keep down the mess and controls the inevitable sugar rush.<br>


     <h3> 7. PARTY BAGS</h3>
A going home gift is all part of the birthday magic and is pretty simple to put together. Yes, you can buy little plastic bags and fill them with sweets and plastic toys, but if you have the time (and patience) you could also get crafty and make your own.

Cake pops, homemade cookies or a slice of birthday cake are good party bag fillers. While creating individual name tags for each child is a really sweet way of thanking them for being there. If you’re holding a party for a small group, you can decorate paper bags (and get the birthday girl or boy to help) so that the going home gift is really personal.

If all else fails, head down to your local supermarket to stock up on stickers, writing books and coloured pencils to create a non-sugar filled and useful treat.
