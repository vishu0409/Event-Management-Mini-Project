                   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Katherine Mansfield was a New-Zealandian writer, who is most recognized for her modernist short stories reflecting a vast range of subjects from family values, sexuality, life, death, relationships to injustice in society, social divisions and war. Her impressive ability to extract the beauty and vitality from whatever the subject discussed, no matter how mundane or difficult it might be, was greatly appreciated, and is revealed in the short story “The Garden Party”.<br>
                   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “The Garden Party” is an almost autobiographical portrayal of Mansfield’s own experiences, which tells us the story of Laura, a young girl from a wealthy, upper class who discovers the reality of life, within the scope of the garden party and the death of a neighbor.
Mansfield uses a third person limited narrative style for the most of the story, providing the reader an in-depth understanding in the Laura’s perspective, and a chance to observe her actions from the outside. This narrative is disturbed only in a few instances, to provide a glimpse in to Mrs. Sheridan’s and Jose’s perspectives. The use of internal dialogue throughout the story is a signature technique of Mansfield, providing an easy flowing rhythm to the narration, and it fully immerses the reader in the story, making him empathize with the character as of his own accord. The lack of male characters in the story is also noteworthy, as is the emphasis on the female perspective.
