Where apart from all the formal greetings and traditions the informality of the senior students and teachers can be seen. The ice breaks there which all the people in the institute look forward to. The sect college of professional education organised a welcome party for the first year students in which apart from the formal speeches of the faculties an array of cultural activities were presented for the students. Amongst the first year students Kalyani Nasre and Khushboo Kumari were felicitated with the title of Miss SECT and Miss Beauty respectively.</center>
