                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;If you've been to a Hindu wedding, you'll know that they are often long, fantastical, and opulent events. 
                "Hindu weddings are traditionally elaborate events lasting multiple days. While the ceremony is only one of the days, 
                the festivities and traditions surrounding the wedding stretch the event out," says Miller.<br><br>
                   <b><h3> &nbsp; &nbsp;1. Baraat (the Groom's Arrival) :</h3></b><br>
The baraat is the groom's wedding procession where the groom arrives on a ceremonial white horse escorted by all his friends and family. There is often live music and dancing, which can go on for hours. The groom can also make a grand entrance on an elephant, chariot, or vintage car.<br>
<b><h3> &nbsp; &nbsp;2. Milni :</h3></b><br>
The groom is greeted by the parents of the bride and her closest friends during the milni. He could be given shagun—a token of good luck—cash, or clothes. Sometimes the bride's parents feed him.<br>
                    <b><h3> &nbsp; &nbsp;3. Jai Mala Garland Exchange :</h3></b><br>
"The bride and groom perform a garland exchange under a mandap or a beautifully decorated, raised canopy-like platform," says Miller. It symbolizes welcoming each other into their families. The bride's parents will join the couple's hands, as a symbol of giving their daughter away. The ceremony begins, the couple is joined by their parents under the mandap, and the priest begins prayers in Sanskrit.<br>
 <b><h3> &nbsp; &nbsp;4. Agni Poojan :</h3></b><br>
In the center of the mandap, a sacred fire, or Agni Poojan, is lit. The rite invokes the fire deity Agni, brought to life through the fire, to bear witness to the celebration. The bride throws fistfuls of rice to the fire as offerings known as homam.<br>

<b><h3> &nbsp; &nbsp;5. Saptapadi :</h3></b><br>
This is where you take seven steps together to symbolize friendship—the basis of a Hindu marriage. Depending on specific geographical traditions, your garments may be tied together, and you may take seven steps or circle the fire seven times. This is the most important step in a Hindu marriage, and after this, you are officially married.<br>

<b><h3> &nbsp; &nbsp;6. Final Blessings :</h3></b><br>
"The ceremony typically ends with prayers, readings, and blessings from their elders," says Miller. The couple's parents and priest typically bless the newlyweds but special guests are also encouraged to join in.
