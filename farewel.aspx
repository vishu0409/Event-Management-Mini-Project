                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A farewell party is held for many occasions. It's a great way to send off your friend, co-worker, and loved one with great memories. You can throw a farewell party when someone leaves work, leaves the country, or is starting a new chapter in any capacity. Organizing a farewell party can take a bit of work. From planning, inviting, setting up, and honoring your guest, there's a lot to do. Luckily, you can enlist the help of your friends, co-workers, etc., to help you. With a bit of planning and teamwork, you'll give your guest of honor a party to remember.<br>
               &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If your friend is moving away think about what kind of themes would work. You might want to host a "bon voyage" party that utilizes themes of travel and exploration. Maybe your party highlights some of the best local things your friend loves. In addition, you can introduce some culture and cuisines that are local to the next place your friend is going.
             Maybe the guest of honor is leaving work and moving to a new company. You might want to throw a party that highlights all the great work this person did at your office.
Incorporate your theme into the invitations, food, decorations, etc. For example, if your friend is moving to another state or country, you could make cupcakes with that place's colors.
