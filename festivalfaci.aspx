               <h3> 1. Determine the Reason</h3><br>
You could organize a festival just for the sake of it, of course. But the most successful events are built around a mission, a purpose. Ask yourself: what’s the reason for this festival?

Consider Ruidosa Festival. This traveling event aims to highlight Latinx women musicians of all genres with a deliberate emphasis on intersectionality.<br>
                    <h3>2. Gather the Lineup</h3><br>
Once you’ve figured out the mission of your fest, the lineup should come easily — or your ideal version of it, at least. Set a goal for how many acts you want to include, then start reaching out to gauge availability and interest. Don’t count on landing every band you want; your dream lineup may not be possible (yet).

One piece of advice is to book the headlining acts as early as possible. When they’re confirmed, you can begin to contact the smaller and local acts on your shortlist and create a long list of backup acts in case some artists fall through or cancel. (There’s always a few).<br>

                    <h3>3.Budgeting for Your Acts</h3><br>
When building the lineup, you’ll need to consider the cost of each band or artist against what you expect to make. If you’re planning a free event, will you be able to negotiate any payment from the venue? Will you take donations? Ticketed events are a bit easier to calculate, of course.

Figure out how much you’ll charge based on the ideal lineup and multiply it by your estimated attendance, then subtract any operational costs. The result is the sum from which you can pay bands.<br>
<h3>3. Add DJs, Vendors, and More</h3>
There’s nothing wrong with programming a straightforward lineup of bands and artists, especially when they’re really great live acts. But adding extra elements to spice things up will really help define your festival’s identity.

Get creative and mix things around a bit with performance artists, installations, poets and readings, some food, various lighting combinations and stage designs, etc. Mixing your bills with tons of different acts is a tough balance to strike, but when done right, it will result in a healthily diverse crowd of fans with performers bringing their own followings.<br>
                    <h3>4. Secure a Location</h3><br>
Keep in mind the scale of your event — how many days it will last, the number of performing bands and artists, whether not you’ll need space for vendors or other activities — when choosing a location.

The obvious options, of course, are local venues already set up for live shows. Booking several nights in a row is a big commitment for any club, so it’s important to know your potential draw to figure out whether or not the space is appropriately suited for a fest. Don’t discount the option of using multiple venues, either. You could secure a sizable spot for the full-day lineup and a smaller one for a shorter opening night.<br>
