               &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Planning a party but don’t know where to start? 
                     Take the guesswork out of your planning with our easy-to-follow party planning checklist. Our venue experts have set out the essential steps to help you host 
                     a memorable event without breaking a sweat. Leave the stress behind with our comprehensive party planning checklist and get the party started!
                     A month before, or even more:<br>
<h3>Select a date and time</h3><br>
Keep a date in mind, but don’t narrow yourself down to just one day. Be flexible and check whether the most important guests are available for your chosen date. If you have a favourite place where you want to organise your event, it’s also good to check with the venue beforehand to see if they are available for hire on your selected day.<br>
<h3>Decide on a theme</h3><br>
Decide what type of party you’d like to host and book/decorate your venue accordingly.<br>
<h3>Plan your guestlist</h3><br>
Begin deciding whom you would like to invite, bearing in mind that expected turnout is usually around the 70-80% mark.<br>
<h3>Determine your budget</h3><br>
Be realistic and concentrate on where you’d like to splurge and save.<br>
<h3>Hire a venue or host it yourself</h3>
Choose whether you’d like to host your party at a specific venue or at home. Bear in mind the number of guests you plan to invite and the activities you will organise. Hosting at home can save you a lot of money, but hiring a venue can also make your life easier and alleviate the pressure. Our free to use venue finder at Tagvenue.com can help you choose from a wide range of different venues. <br>
<h3>Invite your guests</h3><br>
Your invitations should include the date and time, dress code, and party theme. In addition to paper invitations, you could also create a special event page on social media, such as Facebook. This will inspire your guests even more and help create a buzz around your party, while hopefully maximising your turnout.<br>
<h3>Connect different people in the same room</h3><br>
Try and connect guests that haven’t met before by introducing them through interests they have in common. If you do this early on it will create a relaxed atmosphere where everyone feels like they know everyone else. <br>

<h3>Relax and enjoy</h3><br>
So long as you’re organised before, there shouldn’t be many issues that arise during the party, so try to relax and enjoy it yourself. If your guests see that you’re overwhelmed, this can rub off on them and dull the atmosphere. If you can afford it, it’s always possible to leave it to the professionals and hire a party promoter as well. Just remember that your main priority is for you and your guests to be happy and enjoy the night!
