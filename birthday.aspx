               &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   In many parts of the world,[vague] an individual's birthday is celebrated by a party where a specially made cake, usually
                 decorated with lettering and the person's age, is presented. The cake is traditionally studded with the same number of lit 
                candles as the age of the individual, or a number candle representing their age. The celebrated individual will usually make a
                  silent wish and attempt to blow out the candles in one breath; if successful, a tradition holds that the wish will be granted. <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   In many cultures, the wish must be kept secret or it won't "come true". Presents are bestowed on the individual by the guests 
                appropriate to their age. Other birthday activities may include entertainment (sometimes by a hired professional, i.e. a clown,
                 magician, or musician), and a special toast or speech by the birthday celebrant. The last stanza of Patty Hill's and Mildred Hill's 
                famous song, "Good Morning to You" (unofficially titled "Happy Birthday to You") is typically sung by the guests at some point in the 
                proceedings. In some countries a piñata takes the place of a cake.
