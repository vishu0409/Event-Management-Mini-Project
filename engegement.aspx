                the families are ready for the engagement ceremony. The engagement ceremony can be held at bride’s family home or in a different
                 place at the presence of families and friends of the couples. According to tradition, all expenditures of the ceremony should be 
                borne by the bride’s family. During the ceremony, the bride and the groom stand with a senior member of the family. </p>

                 engagement tied together with a long red ribbon are put on a tray, which a young girl carries. Senior family member put the rings 
                to the fingers of the couples and cuts the ribbon with the accompaniment of standard words and wishes. After this ritual, the couples 
                kiss senior family members’ hand, photos are taken. In some regions, the guests dance after the ceremony. During the ceremony, jewelry

                 wedding day. The engagement is not an official step for a wedding. It is an old tradition and celebration through which the couples 
                share their intention for marriage. 
                It is claimed that the history of the engagement rings dates back to 2000 B.C. In Ancient Egypt, people used to carve some plants as a ring, because it was believed that the circle shape symbolizes the eternity. In this way, they thought that they symbolized immortality of the love.
