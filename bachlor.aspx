A stag night is usually planned by the groom's friend or brother, occasionally with the assistance of a bachelor party planning company.

The first references to Western stag nights in the Oxford English Dictionary date to the 19th century. Traditionally, stag nights involved a black tie banquet hosted by the father of the groom that included a toast in honour of the groom and bride.[4] Since the 1980s, some bachelor parties in the United States have involved vacationing to a foreign destination,[4] or have featured female company such as strippers or topless waitresses.
The bachelor party dates back as early as the 5th century B.C. The ancient Spartans celebrated the groom's last night as a single man in which they held a dinner and made toasts on his behalf.
