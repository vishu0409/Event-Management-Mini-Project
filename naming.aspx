               <font font face="roman" size="5" > &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  A naming ceremony is a stage at which a person or persons is officially assigned a name. The methods of the practice differ 
                over cultures and religions. The timing at which a name is assigned can vary from some days after birth to several months or many years.<br>

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
In Hinduism, the ceremony is traditionally known as Namkaran or Namakarana Sanskar, this ceremony is conducted in an elaborative form on the 12th day after birth. In Kerala, this is conducted on 28th day and called as Noolukettu(transl. tying thread).

In Nepal, the naming ceremony is known as Nwaran. In the Hindu tradition, the Nwaran is celebrated on the 11th day (for girls and boys) from the day of birth.
                    This ceremony is performed to give a birth name to a child, according to their lunar horoscope, which is usually not the name by which they 
                   are known. Typically, a priest is invited to perform the ceremony at home, who finds the child's lunar horoscope from his birth details, 
                   as the mother is still recovering at home with the child. It is also known as Machabu Byakegu in Newari. It takes place on the 11th day.<br> 
                 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;   This ceremony is performed to give a birth name to a child according to his/her lunar horoscope, this is usually not the name by which 
                   he/she will be known. The Chhathi Ceremony is performed when the baby is six days old. This ceremony is primarily for women and is timed to take place late at night, say between ten o'clock and midnight. According to folklore, there was a belief that on the 6th day after the birth of the child, Vidhaata (Goddess of destiny) would quietly enter the house around midnight to pen the destiny of the newborn.
