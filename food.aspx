These festivals have always been a means of uniting communities through celebrations of harvests and giving thanks for a plentiful growing season.<br>
                 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Food Festivals throughout the world are often based on traditional farming 
                  techniques, seasons Food festivals are related to food culture of an area, whether through the preparation of food served or the time period in which the festival
                   is celebrated. Food festivals are considered strengthening agents for local cultural heritage, and simultaneously celebrate this cultural heritage while also 
                  commodifying it for a broader national or international audience.[1] While historically aligned with culturally significant food harvesting periods, contemporary 
                  food festivals are usually associated with businesses entities or nonprofit organizations and engage a great deal of marketing for their festivals, since their 
                  success is measured off how much revenue they generate for the local community, region, or entity putting on the event.[2] Modern food festivals are also a large part
                   of the food tourism industry, which uses food festivals and regional cuisine to support the broader tourism industry of a particular locality.
