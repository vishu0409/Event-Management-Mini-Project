                     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the first pre-wedding ceremony in most cultures, planning an engagement ceremony is not given as much importance as the rest of the events that follow. That's why we will guide you on how to host a spectacular engagement ceremony.<br>
                    <h3> Ring Ceremony</h3><br>
                     Engagement ceremony or Sagaai has become synonymous with the ring ceremony. Traditionally, Sagaai involved both the families exchanging gifts like groom's jewellery, bride's wedding attire, gifts for the immediate family and for the deities. Exchanging rings during this ceremony is a western wedding tradition that we have adopted. Thus, wedding rings have become the star of the whole affair so they should be bought carefully. <br>
                    <h3> 1. Engagement ring for the bride</h3><br>
When selecting an engagement ring for bride, keep in mind her choices for a fail-proof shopping experience. If you have budget constraints, consider a halo setting for your choice of stone. What it does is make the centre stone look bigger and make her flaunt the ring even more.<br>
<h3>2. Engagement ring for the groom</h3>
If your idea of a ring for the groom is a simple wedding band then you should update yourself with the latest designs. But if your groom wants a simple band, inscribing the ring with a quote is a good way to personalise it. That would make it an even more loved keepsake of your marriage. <br>
<h3>3.Cake Cutting</h3><br>
Another western tradition that we have adopted is cake cutting at the wedding festivities. Be it a Mehndi cake you want or an engagement cake, everything is available these days. Right after you've exchanged the rings and taken the blessings of the elders, cut the cake in celebration.<br>
