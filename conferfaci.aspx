                    <h3>  THEME </h3><br>

Every great conference needs a theme. What’s the unifying message that your speakers will deliver and what’s the key takeaway for conference attendees?


The best themes are catchy, relatable, and trigger an emotional response. You want the conference to inspire and stimulate conversation. Your theme has to enable that.


For instance, “Stronger as a team” is probably a better theme than “Achieving improved efficiencies through increased cross-functional collaboration.”


The theme is more than just a rallying cry for all participants; it will also guide your branding and promotion, from designing a logo to coming up with social media hashtags to printing your posters, brochures, and other collateral.<br>
<h3>Assemble your A-team</h3><br>

Chances are, you won’t be organising a whole conference all by yourself. (In fact, we’d be shocked if that were the case.)


You’ll need a dedicated team of people to assume responsibility for different aspects of the planning, negotiations, and promotion. Your core team will likely include:<br>

<b>Planning team:</b> Conference venue, accommodation, activities, catering.<br>
<b>Administration team:</b> Budgeting, attendee registration, ticket sales. This team/person will also be the main point of contact for questions related to the conference.<br>
<b>Marketing team:</b> Contacting the media, creating promotional material, managing your website, blog, and social media activities.<br>
<b>Sponsorships team:</b> In charge of securing sponsors, applying for grants, and fundraising. (Only relevant for conferences that rely on external sources of finance. Obviously)<br>
<b>Volunteers:</b> Helping with all on-site activities on the day of the conference: door management, ticket scanning, keeping track of the guest list, manning the wardrobe, guiding people, etc.
Your main job will be to coordinate the team, set priorities, and delegate tasks.<br>
<h3>Settle on a date</h3><br>

Now it’s time to decide when your conference will take place. As discussed, that date should be anywhere from six months to a year ahead.


You also need to find out how long the conference will last. Industry consensus suggests that a conference with around 300 participants calls for two full days. Larger, more in-depth conferences may stretch for even longer.<br>
<h3>Arrange catering & other vendors [optional]</h3><br>

Typically, a dedicated conference venue will also provide on-site catering. If that’s not the case, you’ll need to bring in external vendors.


Decide on what type of refreshments you want to offer and how many breaks there’ll be for food. Reserve up to an hour for lunch and a few 15-20 minute breaks for coffee and snacks. Remember: If there’s room in your budget, it’s always best to go for proper hot meals instead of sandwiches when it comes to lunch.


You want to be sure that the catering company can handle the logistics on the day of the event. Your best bet is to find a local company close to the conference venue to avoid potential traffic-related issues and delays.


Don’t forget to check how far in advance the caterer needs to know the final headcount, the menu, and any special dietary requirements. That way you’ll also know what “RSVP by” date to put on the conference invite.


Think about any other external vendors you might need, such as a decorating company or suppliers of special IT equipment.<br>
